# RAG-LLM: Retrieval-Augmented Generation System from Scratch

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built completely from scratch.

## Overview

RAG-LLM combines the power of:

- Custom-built retrieval systems to fetch relevant context from a knowledge base
- Large Language Models for context-aware text generation

## Features

### RAG Implementation

- **Document Processing**: Pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and chunking documents
- **Vector Embedding**: Custom embedding system for semantic understanding of content
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Advanced retrieval mechanisms to find the most relevant information
- **Context Integration**: Seamless merging of retrieved context with user queries
- **Response Generation**: High-quality responses based on retrieved information
